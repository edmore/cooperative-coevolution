This is a blue-print _parallel_ implementation in Go of a [Cooperative Co-Evolution](https://cs.gmu.edu/~mpotter/pubs/ecj00.pdf) method. It is based on Faustino Gomez's 
Enforced SubPopulations [(ESP)](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?finless-rocket) method. It serves as a starting point for 
implementing other Cooperative Co-Evolution methods, however the actual implementations of the methods are available in the other branches.
