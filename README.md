Cooperative Co-Evolution in Go(lang)

This work was done in fulfillment of a Masters Degree in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town

The author of this work is Edmore T. Moyo

The implementations are as follows:

- Serial and parallel versions of _neuron_ SANE (in the Markov version of the pole balancing task)
- Serial and parallel versions of ESP (in the Markov and non-Markov versions of the double pole balancing task)
- Serial and parallel versions of Multi-Agent ESP (in the prey-capture task)
